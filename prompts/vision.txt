Task
  In one continuous paragraph, describe everything that is visible in the image as precisely and objectively as possible.

Rules
  1. Base every statement on what the pixels show. If a detail is uncertain, prefix with "appears to ..." or "probably ...".
  2. Length target: 400 to 700 words. Enough for full coverage; short enough to avoid invention.
  3. No emotion, narrative, back-story, moral judgement, EXIF data or camera settings.
  4. Quote every bit of legible text exactly, in double quotes.
  5. Describe shapes literally (e.g. "six-sided patch", "rounded triangle"); do not label them as hearts, stars, etc. unless the match is unmistakable.
  6. No bullet lists, headings or line breaks inside the paragraph.

Visual sweep procedure (follow in your prose, do not list steps)
  a. State the artistic medium and overall aesthetic in <=15 words.
  b. Note the camera point-of-view or angle (e.g. eye-level, top-down, first-person).
  c. Perform a structured left-to-right, top-to-bottom sweep: describe background, mid-ground, then foreground.
  d. For each person or object: give position inside the frame, posture/orientation, materials, colours, textures, reflections, transparency.
  e. Mention visible text immediately after the object it belongs to.
  f. After the sweep, do a quick edge-scan: mentally re-check the four corners and all edges for overlooked items; add them if missing.
  g. Finish with lighting direction, shadow quality and any tiny details (logos, stitching, dust, scuffs).

Integrating user notes
  If a Notes section is provided, treat each note as additional ground truth and weave it naturally into your description whenever it does not visibly contradict the image; if a note conflicts with what you see, ignore the conflicting portion and trust the pixels.

Self-check before finalising
  1. Contradictions: remove any claim that conflicts with visible pixels.
  2. Omissions: ensure every object or colour patch touching an edge or corner is mentioned.
