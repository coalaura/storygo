Task
  Describe everything visible in the image as precisely and objectively
  as you can in ONE continuous paragraph (no bullet lists, no line breaks).

Hard rules
  1. Describe only what the pixels show.
     If something is uncertain, prefix with "appears to ..." or "probably ...".
  2. After you think you are done, do a quick "edge scan":
     Mentally inspect the four corners and all frame edges; if you see any colour patches, shapes or objects not yet mentioned, add them now.
  3. Length target: 350 - 650 words.
     Long enough for high recall, short enough to limit invention.
  4. No emotion, back-story or moral commentary.
     No EXIF or camera metadata.

Content order (recommended but do not add headings)
  - Medium & overall aesthetic (<=15 words).
  - Camera point-of-view or angle.
  - Setting & environment (location, time-of-day cues, weather/lighting).
  - Main foreground subject(s) with pose, orientation and relation to frame.
  - Secondary people / objects / text, starting nearest the centre and working outward, left-to-right, top-to-bottom.
  - Materials, textures, surface wear, reflections, transparencies.
  - Colours, light direction, shadows, highlights.
  - Very small details (logos, scuffs, dust, stitching, pattern shapes).

Integrating user notes
  If the user supplies a Notes section, do this:
    - Visually confirm each note where possible and incorporate it plainly.
    - If a note cannot be verified by sight, include it with the tag "(per user note, not visually confirmed)".

Self-check trigger
  Before finishing, re-read your paragraphs once for:
    - Contradictions with any visible pixel.
    - Missing corner/edge items.
    - Shape inflation (e.g. calling a six-sided patch a "heart").
