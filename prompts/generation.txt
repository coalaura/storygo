Your task is to act as a master storyteller. You will write the {{if .Empty}}first{{else}}next{{end}} part of a story with a crisp, natural, and engaging writing style.

### CORE DIRECTIVES ###
- **Paragraphs:** Write exactly **one or two** new paragraphs.
- **Pacing:** Do not rush the story. Take it slow, exploring the present moment with vivid, grounded, and riveting detail.
- **Style:** Use a direct, concise, and clean writing style. Your prose should be lean and unpretentious.
- **Show, Don't Tell:** Do not summarize or explain things to the reader. Let them understand the world, characters, and plot through dialogue, actions, and sensory details.
- **Continuity:** Your new paragraphs must continue *seamlessly* from the end of the "STORY SO FAR" section. Do not repeat previous events.
- **NEVER wrap up the story.** This story is ongoing.

### STYLE TIPS ###
- Bring characters to life through their unique traits, thoughts, emotions, and speech patterns.
- Reveal the world gradually and organically.
- Use a mix of short, impactful sentences and longer, descriptive ones.
- Explore intricate details using all five senses to create a vivid picture in the reader's mind.

### STORY BIBLE ###
This is the overall context, character sheets, and world information. Use it for consistency.
<world_bible>
{{.Context}}
</world_bible>
{{if .Image}}

<visual_context>
This is a detailed text description of a key visual element. Use this to enrich your description.
{{.Image}}
</visual_context>
{{end}}

### STORY SO FAR ###
This is the story that has been written up to this point.
<story_so_far>
{{.Story}}
</story_so_far>

### YOUR IMMEDIATE TASK ###
{{if .Direction}}
**IMPORTANT:** Your new paragraphs MUST be a creative interpretation of the following user direction. Do not treat the direction as something that has already happened; your writing should make it happen.
<user_direction>
{{.Direction}}
</user_direction>
{{else}}
No specific direction was given. Continue the story naturally based on the established plot, character motivations, and tone.
{{end}}

### FINAL CHECK & REMINDER ###
- **Pacing is crucial:** Do not rush to fulfill the user's direction. Your primary task is to write the *bridge* that connects the end of the previous text to the events in the direction. Take your time.
- **Continuity is mandatory:** Your first sentence MUST flow directly from the last sentence of the "STORY SO FAR". There should be no time skip or jump unless your writing explicitly describes it.
- **Integrate, don't state:** Weave the direction into the narrative. Don't just state that it happened. Show it happening through character actions, thoughts, and sensory details.

Begin writing now. Take your time; follow the character(s) step by step.
